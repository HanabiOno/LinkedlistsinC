# Linkedlists

[Assignment 5] (https://advprog.auc-computing.nl/assignment5.html) for Advanced Programming:
Linked lists in C and B(S)T

###linked lists in C
The first step of the assignment making a function: ascending is under the file "linkedlists/list.c"

>In order to test the function please go to the linkedlist directory and give the following commands:
    $ make list_example
    $ list_example <length_of_choice>
    $ make clean
    

###BST
Step 2 in the file "bst.h". The rest of the steps are in the file "bst.c". 

>In order to test the functions please give the following commands:
    $ make bst_example
    $ bst_example
      > What size do you want the test BST to be? <size_of_choice>
    $ make clean

####Remarks
1. For step 5, I followed the breath first search algorithm described on [wikipedia](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
1. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish steps 6 and 10, but the rest works perefectly :)
